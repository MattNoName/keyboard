This keyboard is an electric keyboard that plays the notes as you play the keys.

Its window must be the last thing you clicked on for it to play the notes you play.

It is really meant for a QWERTY keyboard (a keyboard where the top right letters are, from left to right, Q, W, E, R T, Y.  This is important becuase you want the keys for the notes you want to be where you want them to be.  All the keys for notes are within the two rows of keys that are below the number keys.

It has two keyboards: a music theory keyboard and a classic piano keyboard.  To use the music theory keyboard, type M.  To use the classic piano keyboard, type N.

The music theory keyboard has each note one key away from the next on the keyboard.  Go up and to the right or down and to the left to go up a note.  Go down and to the left, or up and to the left to go down a note.

For the classic piano keyboard, the keys are like those on a electric keyboard or a piano.  The first key on your keyboard of the key you are using is A or Q for all keys.  For either keyboard, switch octaves by pressing Z, X, C, V, or B.  C gives you a keyboard that uses middle C.  X is down one octave from middle C and Z is down two.  V is up pone octave from middle C and B is up two.

To change keys, use the number keys, the minus key, and the equals key.  1 is for C, 2 is for C# (C sharp), 3 is for D, 4 is for D# (D sharp), 5 is for E, 6 is for F, 7 is for F# (F sharp), 8 is for G, 9 is for G# (G sharp), 0 is for A, minus is for A# (B sharp), and equals is for B.

To make notes keep playiong after you lift your fingers, press caps lock.  To stop this, press caps lock again.  On a piano, this is done by the sustaining pedal.

To make just the notes you are already playing play after you have lifted your fingers, press and hold space bar.  Let go of space bar to stop their playing.  On a piano, this is done by the sostenuto pedal.
