### Acknowledgments  
Thank you to Osa for introducing me to the Java midi sound library which is used to create sound with your computer.

Thank you to Osa again and to Vanely for encouraging me to create this keyboard.

### Download and Run
To run the application, download keyboard.jar and double click it to run.  The application starts up a little slowly, so please be a little patient.  If it doesn't run at all, please make sure you have Java installed on your computer.

### How to Use It
Here are the directions, which are the only thing displayed on the screen by the app other than any system menus or icons.

This keyboard is an electric keyboard that plays the notes as you play the keys.

Its window must be the last thing you clicked on for it to play the notes you play.

It is really meant for a QWERTY keyboard (a keyboard where the top right letters are, from left to right, Q, W, E, R T, Y.  This is important becuase you want the keys for the notes you want to be where you want them to be.  All the keys for notes are within the two rows of keys that are below the number keys.

It has two keyboards: a music theory keyboard and a piano keyboard.  To use the music theory keyboard, type M.  To use the piano keyboard, type N.

The music theory keyboard has each note one key away from the next on the keyboard.  Go up and to the right or down and to the left to go up a note.  Go down and to the left, or up and to the left to go down a note.

For the piano keyboard, the keys are like those on an electric keyboard or a piano.  The first key on your keyboard of the key you are using is A or Q for all keys.  For either keyboard, switch octaves by pressing Z, X, C, V, or B.  C gives you a keyboard that uses middle C.  X is down one octave from middle C and Z is down two.  V is up one octave from middle C and B is up two.

To change keys, use the number keys, the minus key, and the equals key.  1 is for C, 2 is for C# (C sharp), 3 is for D, 4 is for D# (D sharp), 5 is for E, 6 is for F, 7 is for F# (F sharp), 8 is for G, 9 is for G# (G sharp), 0 is for A, minus is for A# (A sharp), and equals is for B.

To make notes keep playing after you lift your fingers, press caps lock.  To stop this, press caps lock again.  On a piano, this is done by the sustaining pedal.

To make just the notes you are already playing play after you have lifted your fingers, press and hold space bar.  Let go of space bar to stop their playing.  On a piano, this is done by the sostenuto pedal.
